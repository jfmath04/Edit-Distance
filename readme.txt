This project is about the edit distance algorithm, which calculates the distance between two strings based on the edits needed to transform one string into another. This project seeks to implement this algorithm using the Levenshtein distance, along with the creation of our own distance metric based on distances between keys on the keyboard. This is then applied to a document search, a user can choose a document and give a reference word, and the program can output all of the near-matches and their count, as well as produce two visual displays of all the distances between the reference word and the words in the document.
